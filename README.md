## Introduction

This dashboard visualizes data from the Wishing (Gacha) feature of the game Genshin Impact. The data used in this dashboard comes from my personal wish history, which I have collected over 4 years (from 21/12/2021 to 17/03/2025) using https://paimon.moe/wish to scrape and store my data.

When we wish (or simply gacha) in Genshin Impact for our favorite characters, we spend Primogems to pull. We keep farming and grinding all the areas, but sometimes we wonder, "Where did all my Primogems go?" We might want to know the statistics on how much we've pulled on certain banners, but the History feature in Genshin doesn't fully cover that.

Typically, Genshin Impact players aim for 5-star characters, the highest rarity in the game. To understand how close we are to getting one, we need to know how many pulls we've made, because the probability of pulling a 5-star increases when reaching what's known as Soft Pity.

This visualization covers the Descriptive type from the four types of Data Analytics, as it visualizes past data and explains the pulling behavior on each banner. It may also lightly touch on the Predictive type by estimating the probability of getting a 5-star on the next wish using pity as a measure.

## Known Data Limitation

While the dataset provided is generally clean and well-structured, there is a notable inconsistency regarding certain banner types.

Starting from Version 2.3, Genshin Impact introduced **dual-character event banners** under the "Wish 2" type. Unlike standard banners that typically feature a single 5-star character (e.g., *Ganyu* in "Adrift in the Harbor"), these banners featured **two characters simultaneously** (e.g., *Albedo* and *Eula* sharing the same banner and pity count).

However, the current **Wish History export from Genshin Impact** does not differentiate between these dual banners within the dataset. As a result, character names may not always perfectly align with their original banners, and this may require additional logic or workarounds during data processing to maintain accuracy.

## Soft Pity System & Probability Calculation
Genshin Impact uses a dynamic probability system for 5-star drops, also known as Soft Pity. This means the chance of pulling a 5-star increases after a certain number of unsuccessful pulls (typically around the 73rd pull for character banners).

To calculate the correct probability and visualize it, We will refer to community-sourced research and data:
- [The 5\* rate is not uniform - 0.6%, there is a soft pity (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jo9d9d/the_5_rate_is_not_uniform_06_there_is_a_soft_pity/)
- [Soft pity mechanics for the Weapon Banner (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1frlf11/what_is_the_soft_pity_for_the_weapon_banner/)


## Data Cleaning Approached

- We need to retrieve the correct names and types for each banner. This can be achieved using **Google Colab** to run **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** to scrape banner information from reliable sources:
  - [Banner History and Featured 5-Stars](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wish/History)  
  - [List of Type 2 Character Event Wishes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Character_Event_Wishes-2)  
  (*Source: Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki*)

- Since all Wishing data in separate sheets for each types of banner share a similar structure (columns), we can append them together to reduce redundancy.

- To disambiguate banners with identical names but different periods (e.g., Secretum Secretorum have 3 reruns), we can count the number of reruns and assign an index or version number to separate them (e.g., Secretum Secretorum - 1).

- Since the "Wish" history table contains **inaccurate banner names**, we need a robust method to distinguish which rolls belong to which banners. The primary matching criteria will be:
  - **Banner name** & **Time range**  
  We will validate each wish entry by checking if its timestamp falls within the correct banner period, ensuring accurate banner-to-pull mapping.

- Some wish records have banner name collisions. We can clean this by identifying the time periods when banners overlap or merge. Then, we can apply the correct merged banner name and create a **new key table** to handle these relationships properly.

## Planned Features

As part of the ongoing development of this project, the following enhancements are planned to improve both the statistical accuracy and user experience of the dashboard:

1. **Character Pull Probability with Negative Binomial Distribution**  
   Incorporate a negative binomial distribution model to calculate the probability of pulling a specific 5-star character on the nth pull, improving accuracy over the current uniform/soft pity approach.

2. **Refined Stacked Graph with Day-Level Accuracy**  
   Adjust and optimize the existing stacked graph visualization to display more granular, day-level data, ensuring more precise trends and insights on primogem accumulation and banner cycles.

3. **Primogem Calculator + Savings Optimization**  
   Develop a calculator to estimate the number of primogems needed for the next guaranteed 5-star pull, alongside a guide for the fastest passive gem farming strategies (e.g., daily commissions, spiral abyss rewards, events, etc.).

4. **50/50 Outcome and Next 5-Star Predictor**  
   Add a feature to calculate and visualize the playerâ€™s 50/50 history and predict the likelihood of winning/losing future 50/50 rolls based on historical data.
